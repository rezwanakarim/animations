# Animations 

This project is a collection of fun and creative web animations I've made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each animation is a separate project stored in its own folder, and they can be easily viewed through the provided links.

## Live Demo

You can view a live demonstration of the animations here: [Animations](https://rezwanakarim.github.io/animations/)



## Overview

This repository is a personal playground where I experiment with various web animations. It's a fun way for me to explore new techniques and push the limits of what can be done with front-end technologies.


## Contributing

This project is just for fun, but if you'd like to contribute or share ideas, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
